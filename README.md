# c2python
Code starter pack for Convert to Code python class

Files included in the project...
- drawBoard.py
  - includes the functions necessary to draw a 3x3 tic-tac-toe board using ASCII characters
- playGameMinimal.py
  - this file includes all of the code necessary to manage a game of tic-tac-toe.  It can act as the base for you to build on and extend (see list of ideas to extend this project below)
- tictactoeEmpty.py
  - this is a scaffold file... the structure is there, but running it will show you that the logic isn't complete.


While this project gives you a basic intro to the Python language, the program that you've written leaves a lot to be desired.  Here are a list of ideas that we've come up with to extend this project and make the game more playable.
- add validation to:
    - make sure that a cell is available (no repeat moves)
    - make sure that input is valid (numbers only, within range)
- Identify a winner
- Allow the players to exit the game and declare a draw (no winner possible)
- Replay/play-again
- Keep track of wins/draws
- Play a sound based on who won
- Allow player 1 to choose X or O
- Allow players to choose their characters
- Play against the computer
